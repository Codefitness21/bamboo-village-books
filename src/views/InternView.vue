            <h4>Executive Intern</h4>
          </div>
          <p>From the inception of Bamboo Village Books in December 2023 until December 2024, Samone Edwards-Tran played
            a pivotal role as an Executive Intern, directly supporting CEO Quinton Taylor-Garcia in various aspects of
            the company's growth and operations. Her contributions were instrumental in establishing Bamboo Village
            Books as a trusted name in independent publishing. As an on-site marketing specialist, Samone engaged with
            readers and authors, helping to promote books at live events, book fairs, and community gatherings. She
            developed marketing strategies to enhance the company's visibility, assisted with branding efforts, and
            contributed to digital and print promotional campaigns. Her ability to connect with audiences and
            effectively communicate the mission of Bamboo Village Books strengthened the company's outreach. In addition
            to marketing, Samone provided critical book review support, evaluating manuscripts for content, coherence,
            and engagement. Her keen editorial eye helped refine storytelling elements, ensuring that Bamboo Village
            Books consistently produced high-quality publications. Her editing expertise assisted authors in polishing
            their work, aligning each book with professional publishing standards. Now, as she embarks on the next
            chapter of her journey, Samone is heading to Full Sail University to pursue a major in Communications. Her
            experience at Bamboo Village Books has provided her with a strong foundation in publishing, marketing, and
            storytellingâ€”skills that will serve her well as she continues to refine her craft and expand her expertise
            in media and communication. Her tenure at Bamboo Village Books reflects her dedication, creativity, and
            passion for the literary and media industries. As she moves forward in her academic and professional career,
            Samone leaves behind a legacy of excellence, and the Bamboo Village Books team is excited to see the impact
            she will make in the world of communications.</p>
